1) wintertime months simulation of successive TCs
:::: expand WRF and ROMS grid to include more southerly genesis and intensification
:::: locations of TCS.
:::: donwload and create WPS processing data for expanded temporal atmospheric data
:::: rewrite initial conditios of ROMS
[267,200] >> [0,40 : 110,150]?
[334,267] >> [-5,40 : 110,160]?


2) check effect of ocean resolution on subsurface response to TC.
3) check model validity, make sure SSH results are similar to observations,
 particularly for prior to TC passage, and see if there is a difference in the SSH
 for post passage.
4) check the reason for the subsurface response to TC (separate heat fluxes) and 
 see if there's any reason for the nontypical response. 
5) check the actual depth of the response, make sure it's actually accurate.
